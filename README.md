# pyreqif

## simple python representation of RIF (Exerpt/HIS/...) Objects in Python ##

## ReqIF-Support planned but not implemented yet ##

currently some basic support to convert: 
* reqif2html.py:
  converts given rif.xml-File to html-File
* reqif2xlsx.py
  converts given rif.xml-File to xlsx-File (Excel)
* example.py
  use for own implementations (e.g. for import reqif-objects in own system)

Note: Import nearly complete but Export is currently buggy 

## Howto Install ##
* git clone https://github.com/ebroecker/pyreqif.git
* python setup.py install
